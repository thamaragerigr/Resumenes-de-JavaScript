# üí° Lecci√≥n 3: Condicionales 

Los condicionales son partes de c√≥digo que determinan si algo se ejecutar√° o no.

<!-- Conditional statements are used to decision based on different conditions. By default , statements in JavaScript script executed sequentially from top to bottom. If the processing logic require so, the sequential flow of execution can be altered in two ways:

Conditional execution: a block of one or more statements will be executed if a certain expression is true

Repetitive execution: a block of one or more statements will be repetitively executed as long as a certain expression is true.

 -->

Existen diferentes tipos de condicionales en JS:

- if  where if a condition is true it is used to specify execution for a block of code.
In JavaScript and other programming languages the key word if use to check if a condition is true and to execute the block code. To create an if condition, we need if keyword, condition inside a parenthesis and block of code inside a curly bracket({}).

- if else where if the same condition is false it specifies the execution for a block of code.If condition is true the first block will be executed, if not the else condition will be executed.

- if else if else this specifies a new test if the first condition is false.On our daily life, we make decision on daily basis. We make decision not by checking one or two conditions instead we make decisions based on multiple conditions. As similar to our daily life, programming is also full conditions. We use else if when we have multiple conditions.

- switch Switch is an alternative for if else if else else. The switch statement starts with a switch keyword followed by a parenthesis and code block. Inside the code block we will have different cases. Case block run if the value in the switch statement parenthesis match with the case vale. The break is to terminate and it does not go down after the condition is satisfied. The default block run if all the cases don't satisfy the condition.

- operadores ternarios (ternary operators)Another way to write conditionals is using ternary operators. We have covered this in other sections but we should also mention it here.
