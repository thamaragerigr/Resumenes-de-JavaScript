# ðŸ’¡ LecciÃ³n 3: Condicionales (if statement)

Conditional statements are used to decision based on different conditions. By default , statements in JavaScript script executed sequentially from top to bottom. If the processing logic require so, the sequential flow of execution can be altered in two ways:

Conditional execution: a block of one or more statements will be executed if a certain expression is true
Repetitive execution: a block of one or more statements will be repetitively executed as long as a certain expression is true. In this section, we will cover if, else , else if statements. The comparison and logical operator we learned in the previous sections will be useful in here.
Conditions can be implementing using the following ways:

if
if else
if else if else
switch
ternary operator
